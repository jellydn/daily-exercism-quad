# Daily Exercism Quad

Daily coding practice on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) — 4 languages, every day.

## Why

- Build consistency via a simple daily habit
- Learn the same problem through different language lenses
- Track progress publicly for accountability

## The Rules

- 1 exercise per day
- Solve in **4 languages**
- Work locally, then submit to Exercism
- Keep solutions small and readable (prefer clarity over cleverness)

## Languages

- Go
- Rust
- TypeScript
- Python

## Repository Structure
