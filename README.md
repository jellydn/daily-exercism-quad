<h1 align="center">Welcome to Daily Exercism Quad 👋</h1>
<p>
  Daily coding practice on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) — 4 languages, every day.
</p>

## Motivation

- Build consistency via a simple daily habit
- Learn the same problem through different language lenses
- Track progress publicly for accountability

## The Rules

- 1 exercise per day
- Solve in **4 languages**
- Work locally, then submit to Exercism
- Keep solutions small and readable (prefer clarity over cleverness)

## Languages

- Go
- Rust
- TypeScript
- Python
